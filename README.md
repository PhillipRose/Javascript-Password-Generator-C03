# Javascript-Password-Generator-C03

## Description 
This is a simplistic password generator that uses confirms, prompts and alerts to create a semi-randomized password between 8 to 128 characters long. There are safeguards in place to prevent invalid user inputs and to prevent a blank password. 

> Note: The randomness of this generator is not enough to provide a strong enough password for commercial use. Recommended for personal use only.
